> **Collaborative real-time chat & music playback**  
> Bring your friends together in virtual listening roomsâ€”chat, queue, vote, and vibe to the same beat.

##  About

**AetherSync** is a prototype for a real-time, collaborative music experience built with modern web technologies. Users can:

- Create or join listening rooms  
- Chat live with synchronized playback controls  
- Build and manage a shared queue (add, vote, skip)  
- Experience low-latency, cross-device audio sync  

This README outlines the project vision, tech choices, and how to get startedâ€”even though itâ€™s not yet deployed.
